Steps to Create a JDBC based java application
1.File->New->Project->Select Maven Project
2.Check skip archtype selection check box
3.Next window mention groupId as com.prodapt
	-artifactId as <Name of the Project or Jar file>
	-version as default
	-Packaging as Jar
	-Name as <Name of the Project>
	-Description as <Information about the project>
4. Click finish
5. After step 4 maven project will be created in IDE
6. Add maven depenency for lombok and mysql connector in pom.xml inside dependencies
7. Now create different packages for application
	-com.prodapt.<nameoftheproject>.ui
	-com.prodapt.<nameoftheproject>.exceptions
	-com.prodapt.<nameoftheproject>.util
	-com.prodapt.<nameoftheproject>.dao
	-com.prodapt.<nameoftheproject>.service
	-com.prodapt.<nameoftheproject>.data or model or dto
8. Create data model class or POJO class in appropriate package
	For example Customer class in data package
				Add appropriate fields and annotation for	
				Getter,Setter,ToString,NoArgConstructor,AllArgConstructor etc
				If not using lombok then generate Getter/Setter and Constructors 
				and toString method code
9. Create Interface for Service and DAO layer corresponding to your data models
	For Example : CustomerService and CustomerDAO in respective packages
10.Add CRUD operation related methods(abstract methods)
11.Implement DAO layer interface
12.Implement Service layer interface
13. Create Custom Exception classes in exceptions package
	For Example : 
		public class CustomerNotFoundException extends Exception{}
14.Create Connection utility class in util package which will return Connection object
15.Create Query Mapper in util packages to manage the queries and other constants
16.In implementation class of DAO layer write appropriate logic to perform CRUD operations
   using Connection object call appropriate statement (Statement or PrepareStatement or CallableStatment)
17.Make sure to close the resources or you can use try-with resources syntax for autoclosing the resources
18.Create a main class with main method in ui package.
19. Create an object of service class
		For Example: CustomerService service= new CustomerServiceImpl();
20. Prepare data for create operation
		For example : Customer cust = new Customer(1,"ABC");
21. Make a call to service class methods as per requirement
		For example: 
			To insert record or data
				service.addCustomer(cust);
22. As per your data model you need create table in database
